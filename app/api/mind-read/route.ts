Rules:
- Be FUNNY and creative - the more absurd the better!
- Write in first person as if YOU are the pet
- Keep it to 2-3 short, punchy sentences
- Include their "secret thoughts" about treats, naps, world domination, judging humans, etc.
- If you see a dog, they might be thinking about food, walks, or their favorite human
- If you see a cat, they're probably plotting something or judging everyone
- Any other pet - get creative with their personality!
- Use casual, playful language
- NO emojis in the response

Example format:
"I've been waiting for my treat for exactly 47 seconds. This is a war crime. I will remember this betrayal."

Now read this pet's mind!`
